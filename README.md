## ℹ️ About this repository
This repository's main objective is to demonstrate the application developed to train my knowledge during the Flutter course from the company [COD3R](https://www.udemy.com/course/curso-flutter/).

This app consists of:
- Manage spent Finances (Create, Read, Update and Delete).
- Show the user how much was spent in a week.
- Display financial statistics through graphs.
- Present a responsive layout independent of the device screen.

## 📝 Notes
As I already work with mobile application development, I made some changes during the course.
During the course, the teacher downloaded the fonts directly from the website [fonts.google.com](https://fonts.google.com/).
However, currently in Flutter there is a package that already brings these fonts directly from Google.
So I just imported the package [google_fonts](https://pub.dev/packages/google_fonts) and used the sources it provides.
