## 📝 Notes
As I already work with mobile application development, I made some changes during the course.
During the course, the teacher downloaded the fonts directly from the website [fonts.google.com](https://fonts.google.com/).
However, currently in Flutter there is a package that already brings these fonts directly from Google.
So I just imported the package [google_fonts](https://pub.dev/packages/google_fonts) and used the sources it provides.
